# Docs-As-Code

This repository serves as an example that illustrate how to integrate a single MkDocs project with multiple documentation platforms.

## Prerequisites

## GitHub Pages deployment

The GitHub Pages deployments is an integrated feature of MkDocs that enables you to deploy the documentation to GitHub Pages.

For this to work you need to:

- enable github pages deployment on the repository. https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart

- Set read and write permission for workflows in:
  `Settings > Actions > General`

## Confluence deployment

For deployment to a confluence page we will use the [md2cf] repository and follow the readme from there.
